<small>The ceremony will begin promptly at 6:30 p.m. Dinner and dancing will follow.</small>

<small>The attire for the wedding is Black Tie Optional. We love getting dressed up for weddings, and know some of you do too! Just be sure to wear or bring comfortable shoes, because there will be a lot of dancing.</small>

<small>Were you expecting the wedding venue to be in New Jersey? So were we! The previous venue suddenly closed, so now we’re celebrating across the Hudson in Manhattan. Transportation will be provided to and from the hotel.</small>

## For Our Hotel Guests

<small>There will be a cocktail reception on Friday night at 9 p.m. and a brunch on Sunday morning for wedding guests staying at the hotel. Details to follow.</small>
