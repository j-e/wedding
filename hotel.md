## Where to Stay

We have reserved a block of rooms at the [Westin Jersey City Newport](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/Book/KevesandEllis). Please book your rooms prior to November 8th, 2017, to ensure that you get the group rate.

## Getting There by Plane

The closest airport to the hotel and venue is Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). We recommend taking a cab from the airport to the [hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Westin+Jersey+City+Newport/@40.724857,-74.0384867,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2575363ccf56b:0xc327eb299465b2a0!8m2!3d40.724853!4d-74.036298). Battello is across the street from the Westin.

_Tip:_ You could fly to LGA or JFK, but cab fare and travel time would be significantly greater.

## Getting There by Train

If you are traveling from one of the boroughs via train, take the Path to the Newport station. Once you arrive, it is a five-minute walk to the [hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Newport+Station,+Jersey+City,+NJ+07310/The+Westin+Jersey+City+Newport,+Washington+Boulevard,+Jersey+City,+NJ/@40.7258795,-74.0372527,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c257543ae5b857:0xb16d1f453513c706!2m2!1d-74.03383!2d40.72699!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2575363ccf56b:0xc327eb299465b2a0!2m2!1d-74.036298!2d40.724853) or [venue](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Newport+Station,+Jersey+City,+NJ+07310/Battello,+502+Washington+Blvd,+Jersey+City,+NJ+07310/@40.7261687,-74.0349036,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c257543ae5b857:0xb16d1f453513c706!2m2!1d-74.03383!2d40.72699!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25755aeb0b28b:0xfed2e60c29eec87d!2m2!1d-74.0322764!2d40.7253475).

_Tip:_ Unless you are familiar with Path, please allow extra time and be aware that weekend service uses a different [line configuration](http://www.panynj.gov/path/maps.html).

## Getting There by Car

Parking is available at the hotel and Battello. There is limited parking at Battello.

_Tip:_ If you plan to drive directly to the venue, please email us at [weddyforthisjelly@gmail.com](mailto:weddyforthisjelly@gmail.com), so we can ensure that there is a spot for you! If you are staying at the hotel, parking is available for a fee.
