## Where to Stay

We have reserved a block of rooms at the Westin Jersey City Newport. Please book your rooms [at this link](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/Book/KevesandEllis) prior to November 8th, 2017, to ensure that you get the group rate.

## If You’re Flying

The closest airport to the hotel is Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). We recommend taking a cab from the airport to the [hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Westin+Jersey+City+Newport/@40.724857,-74.0384867,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2575363ccf56b:0xc327eb299465b2a0!8m2!3d40.724853!4d-74.036298).

You can fly to LGA or JFK, but cab fare and travel time to the hotel will be significantly greater.

## If You’re Driving

Parking is available at the hotel for a fee. Here is the [Westin Jersey City Newport on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Westin+Jersey+City+Newport/@40.724857,-74.0384867,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2575363ccf56b:0xc327eb299465b2a0!8m2!3d40.724853!4d-74.036298).
