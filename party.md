## Jamie Statter

### Officiant, Friend of the Couple
Jamie and Aly met at Stuart Country Day School, when Aly assistant-directed Jamie in the 8th grade musical, “The Wizard of Oz” (Jamie played Uncle Henry, which was the first of many times that one of them played a boy in a Stuart production). Jamie and Jonathan met years later in New York City and always had a good time going out with friends and laughing about everything. Jamie has known both of us for longer than we have known each other and we are so happy that she has agreed to marry us.

## Genna Erway

### Matron of Honor, Friend of the Bride
Genna and Aly met while they were both rushing Chi Omega. They went to a frat party one night, got bored and started talking. Genna asked Aly where she was from, and Aly said “a small town in New Jersey that no one has ever heard of.” Genna said, “I’m from NJ too. Try me.” Aly told her she was from East Windsor, and Genna told her that she had in fact heard of it as she was from West Windsor. They’ve been inseparable every since.

## Kristen Bedard

### Bridesmaid, Friend of the Bride
Aly met Kristen sophomore year of college when they lived in the same dorm. They went on to live together for 2 years off-campus, where they started a prank war that has never ended. They share a love of Lilly Pulitzer and the TV show “Friends.”

## Aimee Murray

### Bridesmaid, Friend of the Bride
Kristen introduced Aly to Aimee junior year of college. The three of them lived together senior year, which is where Aim accidentally broke Aly’s car key in her car door.

## Meeghan Milette

### Bridesmaid, Friend of the Bride
Meegs and Aly met a few days into freshman year of college at a Student Entertainment Club meeting. It was pretty much love at first sight.

## Laura Keves

### Bridesmaid, Bride’s Sister-in-Law
Aly met Laura a few years ago when my brother brought her home to meet the family for the first time. It was a successful meeting. They got married this past July, so now she’s stuck with us!

## Sarah Crucilla

### Bridesmaid, Groom’s Cousin
Sarah is Jonathan's one and only first cousin! She is currently a freshman at Caltech in Pasadena and is by far the smartest person in the wedding party.

## Eugene Kang

### Best Man, Friend of the Groom
Eugene and Jonathan were classmates from first grade to 12th grade and did everything together: baseball teams, class projects, student newspapers, school plays, improv comedy, jazz bands, mock trials and failed political campaigns. Now they live in New York and D.C., they’ve worked in media and politics, and they still try to do things together as often as possible.

## Xander Cooper

### Groomsman, Friend of the Groom
Xander and Jonathan hold the bridal party record for longest friendship — they met when they were 2 years old! More than 30 years later, every time they see each other, they pick up right where they left off.

## Fred Upton

### Groomsman, Friend of the Groom
Jonathan met Fred when he was the new kid in middle school and they’ve been best friends ever since. One time Fred joined the JV golf team just to support Jonathan. That is pretty much all you need to know. Also, they were Chippendales Rejects for Halloween.

## Tony “Dirty T” Sheets
<img src="/images/tony.jpg" alt="Tony" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail content-img-small center-block" />
### Groomsman, Friend of the Groom
Tony and Jonathan were randomly assigned to the same freshman unit in college, and boy was that fortuitous. (Note: The definition of fortuitous is “happening by chance,” not necessarily “lucky” or “fortunate.”) (Bride’s note: Yup.)

## Frank Lehman

### Groomsman, Friend of the Groom
Frank and Jonathan bonded freshman year over the fact that John Williams composed the theme to “NBC Nightly News.” Breaking News: The rest is history.

## Matt Keves

### Groomsman, Future Brother-in-Law of the Groom
The first time Jonathan met Matt was when they sat in a car together for four hours on the way to play Bingo in Connecticut. After a tiny fender bender, Matt scared the other guy off after the guy tried to scam him into paying cash for an accident that the other guy intentionally caused. Jonathan knew this relationship would work. Also, Jonathan officiated Matt and Laura’s wedding!

## Matzah Ellis

### Honorary Groomsman, Dog of the Bride and Groom
Aly tried to convince Jonathan to adopt a dog for months, but Jonathan kept saying no, he didn’t know how to take care of a dog. After showing him hundreds of dogs on Petfinder.com, Aly showed Jonathan Matzah, and Jonathan said, “This is a good Jewish dog who needs a good Jewish home.” Matzah is far more curmudgeonly than we ever could have imagined, and is, in fact, a Jewish old man. We could not love him more.
