The weather may be chilly, but it will be the holiday season in New York, which means there will be plenty to do!

Here are a few of our suggestions:

- Browse the holiday markets in [Columbus Circle](http://urbanspacenyc.com/columbus-circle-holiday-market/) or [Union Square Park](http://urbanspacenyc.com/union-square-holiday-market/).
- Go ice skating at [Rockefeller Center](https://therinkatrockcenter.com/), and get a great view at [Top of the Rock](https://www.topoftherocknyc.com/).
- There's a holiday market and ice skating in [Bryant Park](http://urbanspacenyc.com/holiday-shops-bryant-park/).
- Take a walking tour and see all of the [holiday window displays](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=15Le_uCGcPcERrzPlFohegnjclkc&hl=en_US&ll=40.75704250618664%2C-73.97814627044681&z=15).
- Visit [Serendipity](http://www.serendipity3.com/) for their famous frozen hot chocolate and recreate [that scene](http://thefoodiemiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/serendipity-cafe-from-movie.jpg) from the movie with the same name.
- Burn off those calories in the NYCRuns [Manhattan Half-Marathon](https://nycruns.com/races/?race=manhattan-half-marathon) in Central Park on December 10, 2017!
